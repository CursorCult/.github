# CursorCult

Opinionated Cursor rules and writing practices for building software that stays readable under pressure.

## What you’ll find here

- **Rule packs**: focused, composable sets of Cursor rules you can drop into a repo
- **Style constraints**: bias toward clarity, testability, and fast refactors
- **Strong defaults**: fewer “maybe”s, more executable intent

## How to use

1. Pick a pack from https://github.com/CursorCult
2. Add its rules to your project (commonly under `.cursor/rules/`)
3. Tune per-repo: keep the rules short, enforceable, and aligned with your team

## Contributing

PRs that make rules **clearer, smaller, and more enforceable** are welcome. If you’re proposing a new pack, keep it narrow and name it after the constraint it enforces.

## License

Unlicense / public domain. See the org `.github` repo for details.
