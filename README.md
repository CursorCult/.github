# CursorCult `.github`

This repository powers **organization-wide defaults** for the CursorCult GitHub org, and serves as the landing zone for shared docs.

## What this repo is for

- **Org profile README**: see `profile/README.md` (renders on https://github.com/CursorCult)
- **Shared GitHub “community health” files** (as we add them): PR templates, issue templates, contributing docs, etc.
- **Pointers to rule packs** hosted in the org

## CursorCult rule packs

Small, opinionated rule packs you can mix-and-match per project:

- `TDD` — test-first workflow
- `SpecsFirst` — write the contract before the code
- `DesignToTest` — design for testability
- `NoMocksNoSkips` — prefer real tests over mocks/skip
- `LimitMocks` — when you *must* mock, keep it tight
- `NoDeadCode` — keep the repo alive and prunable
- `DRY` — duplication is a design smell
- `RAII` — resource lifetime discipline (esp. systems code)
- `TruthOrSilence` — say what you know; don’t guess
- `NoHedging` — remove weasel words, commit to claims
- `EzGrep` — write code that’s easy to search and refactor
- `UMP`, `UNO`, `PUTTPUTT`, `Pinocchio` — specialty packs (see their repos)
